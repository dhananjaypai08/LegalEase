## üíª About The Project
The problem statement revolves around corporate services, 
which is facing a challenge in achieving a balanced gender diversity ratio within their firm. Currently, the company has a men to women ratio of 73:27, indicating a significant gender imbalance. 
Despite their efforts to hire more gender-diverse talent, the company has struggled to make significant progress, mainly due to a lack of supporting data.

To address this issue, AlwaysFirst is seeking an intelligent solution that can help them create and analyze data to improve their diversity ratio. One potential solution presented is "BuildTogether," which is described as a dashboard of diversity and inclusion (D&I) metrics. 
This dashboard aims to enable managers to remain accountable for reaching the company's D&I goals.
